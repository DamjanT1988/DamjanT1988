## About Me

Hello! I'm **Damjan** — a fullstack & systems developer with a background in  
**software engineering, business economics, service design, and UX**.  
I build scalable, human-centered applications where clean architecture,  
strong logic, and thoughtful design come together.

I also bring experience as an **entrepreneur**, having built internal systems,  
web platforms, and e-commerce solutions from the ground up — where technical  
development meets business strategy, operations, and real customer value.
