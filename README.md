## About Me
Hello! I'm **Damjan** — a fullstack & systems developer with a background in  
**software engineering, business economics, and service design (UX)**.  
I build and maintain scalable, human-centered applications where clean 
architecture, strong logic, and thoughtful design come together.

I also bring experience as an **business entrepreneur**, having built internal ERP systems,  
web platforms, intranet applications and e-commerce solutions from the ground up — where 
technical development meets business strategy, operations, and real customer value. Simply, 
I love the contact points of business, human experience and technology, for co-creating value.

## What I Do
- Develop fullstack applications with robust **backend architecture**  
- Design intuitive user experiences using **service design** principles  
- Work across **React** (JavaScript/TypeScript), **C#.NET**, **Django** (Python), PHP/Laravel  
- Implement REST APIs, databases, containers (**Docker**), CI/CD, and cloud systems  
- Conduct user testing, A/B testing, and **unit/integration/E2E** testing  
- Build and design **WordPress CMS** solutions and **e-commerce** using WooCommerce  
- Customize themes and layouts with **Themify Ultra**  
- Use AI as a core productivity tool for analysis, development, and automation  
- Translate complexity into clear, valuable end-to-end solutions  
- Bring a **business-oriented mindset** from years as an entrepreneur
